            <h2>About Bananas</h2>
            <p>Bananas are the ultimate go-to snack! They are sweet, soft, and super easy to take on the go. They're packed with potassium, vitamin B6, and fiber. Bananas are great for smoothies, baking with them, or just eating them as it is. They are an essential for any pantry.</p>
            <p>Bananas are also really cheap! You can buy them for $0.65/lb at the grocery store. You don't need to wash them because you simply peel the skin off. What is not to love?</p>
